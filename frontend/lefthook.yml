      # NOTE: there's one caveat with this hook! When pushing, it will only correctly scan the range of
      # outgoing commits when pushing to a matching branch on the remote (e.g. `git push`) - pushing to a
      # different ref on the remote like `git push origin master:foreign` does not work..
      #
      # For this to work the following issue will need to be fixed (in short: Lefthook does not pass on stdin
      # to the hook script, whereas pre-push is one of the few hooks which retrieves information from there):
      # https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/issues/1471
      #
      # The hook configuration would then turn into:

      # pre-push:
      #   scripts:
      #     secrets-audit:
      #       runner: sh
