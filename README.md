# RIS Norms

**WIP**

## Git hooks

The repo contains a [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/full_guide.md) configuration,
providing a Git hooks setup out of the box.

**To install these hooks, run:**

```bash
./run.sh init
```

The hooks are supposed to help you to:

- commit properly formatted source code only (and not break the build otherwise)
- write [conventional commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- not accidentally push [secrets and sensitive information](https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/)
