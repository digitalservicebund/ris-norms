Java service built with
the [Spring WebFlux reactive stack](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#spring-webflux).

## Prerequisites

Java 17, Docker for building + running the containerized application:

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
brew install --cask docker # or just `brew install docker` if you don't want the Desktop app
```

For the provided Git hooks you will need:

```bash
brew install lefthook node talisman
```

## Getting started

**To get started with development run:**

```bash
./run.sh init
```

This will replace placeholders in the application template and install a couple of Git hooks.

## Tests

The project has distinct unit and integration test sets.

**To run just the unit tests:**

```bash
./gradlew test
```

**To run the integration tests:**

```bash
./gradlew integrationTest
```

**Note:** Running integration tests requires passing unit tests (in Gradle terms: integration tests depend on unit
tests), so unit tests are going to be run first. In case there are failing unit tests we won't attempt to continue
running any integration tests.

**To run integration tests exclusively, without the unit test dependency:**

```bash
./gradlew integrationTest --exclude-task test
```

Denoting an integration test is accomplished by using a JUnit 5 tag annotation: `@Tag("integration")`.

Furthermore, there is another type of test worth mentioning. We're
using [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/getting-started)
for ensuring certain architectural characteristics, for instance making sure that there are no cyclic dependencies.

## Formatting

Java source code formatting must conform to the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
Consistent formatting, for Java as well as various other types of source code, is being enforced
via [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).

**Check formatting:**

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

**Autoformat sources:**

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

## Git hooks

The repo contains a [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/full_guide.md) configuration,
providing a Git hooks setup out of the box.

**To install these hooks, run:**

```bash
./run.sh init
```

The hooks are supposed to help you to:

- commit properly formatted source code only (and not break the build otherwise)
- write [conventional commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- not accidentally push [secrets and sensitive information](https://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman/)

## Code quality analysis

Continuous code quality analysis is performed in the pipeline upon pushing to trunk; it requires a
token provided as `SONAR_TOKEN` repository secret that needs to be obtained from https://sonarcloud.io.

**To run the analysis locally:**

```bash
SONAR_TOKEN=[sonar-token] ./gradlew sonarqube
```

Go to [https://sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=digitalservicebund_java-application-template)
for the analysis results.

## Container image

Container images running the application are automatically published by the pipeline to
the [GitHub Packages Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

**To run the latest published image:**

```bash
docker run -p8080:8080 "ghcr.io/digitalservicebund/java-application-template:$(git log -1 origin/main --format='%H')"
```

The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

We are using Spring's built-in support for producing an optimized container image:

```bash
./gradlew bootBuildImage
docker run -p8080:8080 ghcr.io/digitalservicebund/java-application-template
```

Container images in the registry are [signed with keyless signatures](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KEYLESS.md).

**To verify an image**:

```bash
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify "ghcr.io/digitalservicebund/java-application-template:$(git log -1 origin/main --format='%H')"
```

If you need to push a new container image to the registry manually there are two ways to do this:

**Via built-in Gradle task:**

```bash
export CONTAINER_REGISTRY=ghcr.io
export CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME=digitalservicebund/java-application-template
export CONTAINER_IMAGE_VERSION="$(git log -1 --format='%H')"
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER=[github-user] CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=[github-token] ./gradlew bootBuildImage --publishImage
```

**Note:** Make sure you're using a GitHub token with the necessary `write:packages` scope for this to work.

**Using Docker:**

```bash
echo [github-token] | docker login ghcr.io -u [github-user] --password-stdin
docker push "ghcr.io/digitalservicebund/java-application-template:$(git log -1 --format='%H')"
```

**Note:** Make sure you're using a GitHub token with the necessary `write:packages` scope for this to work.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Scanning container images for vulnerabilities is performed with [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
as part of the pipeline's `build` job, as well as each night for the latest published image in the container
repository.

**To run a scan locally:**

Install Trivy:

```bash
brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy
```

```bash
./gradlew bootBuildImage
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ghcr.io/digitalservicebund/java-application-template:latest
```

As part of the automated vulnerability scanning we are generating a Cosign vulnerability scan record using Trivy,
and then use Cosign to attach an attestation of it to the container image, again
[signed with keyless signatures](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KEYLESS.md) similar to signing the
container image itself. Using a policy engine in a cluster the vulnerability scan can be verified and for instance
running a container rejected if a scan is not current.

## License Scanning

License scanning is performed as part of the pipeline's `build` job. Whenever a production dependency
is being added with a yet unknown license the build is going to fail.

**To run a scan locally:**

```bash
./gradlew checkLicense
```

## Architecture Decision Records

[Architecture decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
are kept in the `docs/adr` directory. For adding new records install the [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) package:

```bash
brew install adr-tools
```

See https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools regarding usage.

## Slack notifications

Opt in to CI posting notifications for failing jobs to a particular Slack channel by setting a repository secret
with the name `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, containing a url for [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
